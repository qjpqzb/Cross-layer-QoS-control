REQUIREMENTS:
    - ADIOS 1.5.0: http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/adios
    - C compiler
    - MPI

BUILD:
    - Install ADIOS
    - In Makefile, set ADIOS_DIR to the installation directory
    - also set the MPI/C compiler name (e.g. mpicc or cc)
    - run make

This example is for writing a uniform 2D mesh and data on it. 
2D mesh is decomposed in x and y direction by npx and npy, which are passed in from the command line following the executable.
npx = number of processes in x direction
npy = number of processes in y direction
X = coordinates of data in x direction
Y = coordinates of data in y direction

Processes write ndx*ndy points per process
data is data on the points (value = rank)

1. Run the writer 
=================
$ mpirun -np 12 ./structured2d 4 3

2. Check the output
===================
  integer  /nproc      scalar = 12 
  integer  /nx_global  scalar = 260 
  integer  /ny_global  scalar = 387 
  integer  /offs_x     scalar = 0 
  integer  /offs_y     scalar = 0 
  integer  /nx_local   scalar = 65 
  integer  /ny_local   scalar = 129 
  double   /X          {260, 387} = 0 / 453.496 / 226.748 / 93.8189 
  double   /Y          {260, 387} = 0 / 386 / 193 / 111.717 
  double   /data       {260, 387} = 0 / 11 / 5.5 / 3.45205 

$ bpls -l structured2d.bp

strctured2d.png is a plot of how the data over the nx_global*ny_global points should look like if visualized.
