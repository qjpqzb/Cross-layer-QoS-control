EXAMPLES
========
- remove old crappy examples, move in new ones from the new tutorials

WRITE
=====

- bring back "write=no" into XML tag to skip some variables
- complete error logging
- undef value (also func: adios_undef_get(), adios_undef_set())
- each method should process parameters from PairStruct, not from string


READ
====
- peek_ahead function to support paraview
- chunking: 
  - support memory limit

- missing data blocks when read should contain undef values

- simple BP reader
    - PG block selection read
    - auto selection read

- DataSpaces staging method
    - per block variable information
    - statistics
    - auto selection should do domain decomposition, not just return the 
      whole dataset per process

TEST
=====
- Test ISOBAR
- The statistics of scalars written over multiple timestep. Particularly we 
need to test adios_complex and adios_double_complex scalars.
- Tests for schema
- Test BP reader without user-allocated memory

- shared libraries (request by Numeca and ETH)
- cross-compile support
- add version defines into adios public header (request by Michele Martone)
