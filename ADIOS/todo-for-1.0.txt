Signs: 
    +: DONE


Packaging:
    - make a 1.0 branch
    + take out the methods that we do not want to distribute
    + review what goes into the distribution and write a script to make the tar.gz
        this is now create_release.sh

New features:
    CANCELLED: write an adiosf module for F90 like adiosf_read in src/adiosf_read_mod.F90

Build:
    - configure: test mxml version 2.5 or higher
    + merge libadios_int into libadios_read
    + merge adios_internals.c and adios_internals_nompi.c

BUGS:
    - configure: FC=mpif90 on ewok breaks configure (it checks if Fortran lib can link with a C main program)
    + bpls: 4np.bp, dump of string variable /var_string is wrong (bpls -l shows correctly)
            dump vs -l of var_complex, var_double_complex is wrong
    - PGI doesn't support "long double" type.

Testing:
    - Install and run genarray and bp_read_f, bpls on
        jaguar
        bgp
        ewok
        a linux box
        lens for a final test (relatively 'new' machine for us)
    - Install and run bpls and bp_read_f on Mac
    - Test Matlab that it can still read in BP files
    - Endianness: genarray/bp_read_f on LE/BE and BE/LE (e.g. ewok and bgp)

Example codes:
    Both Fortran and C for each:
        + write each type supported (including double complex and long double and strings)
        + write attributes (scalars, strings and references to scalar vars and string vars + byte array vars)
        + write global arrays and global arrays over time (C exists)
        + read each type
        + read attributes
        - parallel code to read in global arrays (on different any number of processors)
        - parallel code to read in global time arrays

Doc:
    Manual
        - review write examples 
        - review write api (Section 3)
        - write Fortran write api for section 3 
        - review XML doc (Section 4)
        - review transport methods and remove undistributed ones (Section 5)
        - do we need section 7 BP file format in the manual? review it
        - Edit section 10 into section 3 (gwrite stuff)
        - review C tutorial (which is only for writing) (Section 11)
        - add tutorial on reading
        - Section 12 is one page (Advanced programming)
        - Section 14 FAQ is empty
        - add note on not handling NaN values
        - describe how to add a new transport method

    + write INSTALL
    + write README
    - write AUTHORS


Copyright
    + define copyright
    + add short copyright to each file

Distribution (on adiosapi.org wiki)
    - Put tar.gz on wiki
    - review texts on wiki
    - Can we ask some appl.scientist to publish their xml and some bp files on wiki?
