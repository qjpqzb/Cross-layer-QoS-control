This is to demonstrate using staging method with Adios python
wrapper. Writer (adios_write.py) and Reader (adios_read.py) can take
write method (e.g., POSIX, FLEXPATH, ICEE, etc) and read method (BP,
FLEXPATH, ICEE, etc), respectively, as an argument.

1. How to run
-------------

Command line options are as follows:

$ python ./adios_write.py [write method] [parameters]
$ python ./adios_read.py [read method] [parameters]


2. Examples
-----------

a. File-based communication

First, let's run with files by

$ python ./adios_write.py POSIX1
$ python ./adios_read.py BP

b. ICEE

Now, we can run writer and reader with ICEE staging method:

$ python ./adios_write.py ICEE "verbose=3;cm_port=59990;cm_host=localhost;" &
$ python ./adios_read.py ICEE "verbose=3;cm_remote_port=59990;cm_remote_host=localhost;"

Note: Users may need to use the MPI-enabled Adios module, adios_mpi,
instead of serial adios module, adios. Some Adios methods work only
with MPI. In that case, use import "adios_mpi", not "adios".

c. DataSpaces

Refer job.pbs script to test with DATASPACES method.
adios_write_mpi.py and adios_read_mpi.py communicates through DATASPACES method.
