ADIOS Java wrapper
-----------------

This directory contains the codes for the ADIOS java wrapper, a Java
Native Interface (JNI) program to call the native ADIOS library.


== Build == 

This program can be built with CMake (http://www.cmake.org/). You may
want to a build directory and run cmake pointing the source directory
containing CMakeLists.txt (this directory). For example, 

$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake /dir/to/source

CMake will search installed ADIOS library, Java, JNI, MPI library (if
needed), etc. Once completed, type make to build:

$ make

If you need verbose output, you may add an option:
$ make VERBOSE=1

After successful building, you can see libAdiosJava.so (or
libAdiosJava.dylib in Mac) and AdiosJava.jar. Those two files are
needed to call in Java.

Then, you can install the library by,
$ make install

The default install directory is /usr/local. You can change by
specifying CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX value;

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install /dir/to/source

Or, you can use the ccmake command, the CMake curses interface. Refer
to the CMake documentation for more detailed instructions.

== Test == 

This program contains a test program. To run testing after building,
type the following command:

$ make test

If you need a verbose output, type the following

$ ctest -V
