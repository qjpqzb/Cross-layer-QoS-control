USER REQUESTS
=============
Seismic (Jeroen Tromp), ASDF data format
+ support for 100k and more variables and attributes in one file
- unicode string variable to store XML documents in the file

Others
- support C/C++ structures (without following pointers) as generic data types
  - traverse a tree and flatten into a buffer
- support hyperslab at writing and maybe reading
- streaming support a series of file(name)s, not just appending to the same file(name)

- ship and build the MXML library with the ADIOS release

- create and store metadata in staging methods (like in BP format)
  Detailed per-writer info is completely missing right now.

+ replace INT32_MAX with a smaller number in write methods everywhere to ensure MPI_File_Write works on all machines
