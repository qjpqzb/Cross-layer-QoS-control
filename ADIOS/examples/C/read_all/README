C program to traverse a BP file and list all variables and attributes in all groups.
Arrays less then 1KB are read in and their values printed (scalars, 1D and 2D arrays only).

This code demonstrates the generic read API in a sequential program. 

utils/bpls/bpls.c is basically the same, except for 
- printing the min/max of variables
- sorting the listing, 
- dumping any slice of any variables
