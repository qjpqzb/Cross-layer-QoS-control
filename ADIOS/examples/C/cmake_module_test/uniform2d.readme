This is the examples/C/uniform example but with CMAKE build instructions

REQUIREMENTS:
    - ADIOS 1.5.0: http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/adios
    - CMAKE 2.8.0 or newer
    - C compiler
    - MPI

BUILD with CMAKE
    - Install ADIOS
    - Have cmake 2.8.0 or newer
    - set environment variable ADIOS_DIR to the installation directory
    - set environment variable CC to the MPI C compiler (e.g. mpicc or cc)
    - then do the following commands
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make


This example is for writing a uniform 2D mesh and data on it. 
2D mesh is decomposed in x and y direction by npx and npy, which are passed in from the command line following the executable.
npx = number of processes in x direction
npy = number of processes in y direction
Processes write ndx*ndy points per process
data is data on the points (value = rank)

1. Run the writer 
=================
$ mpirun -np 12 ./uniform2d 4 3

2. Check the output
===================
  integer  /nproc      scalar = 12 
  integer  /nx_global  scalar = 260 
  integer  /ny_global  scalar = 387 
  integer  /offs_x     scalar = 0 
  integer  /offs_y     scalar = 0 
  integer  /nx_local   scalar = 65 
  integer  /ny_local   scalar = 129 
  integer  /O1         scalar = 0 
  integer  /O2         scalar = 0 
  integer  /S1         scalar = 1 
  integer  /S2         scalar = 2 
  double   /data         {260, 387} = 0 / 11 / 5.5 / 3.45205

$ bpls -l uniform2d.bp

uniform2d.png is a plot of how the data over the nx_global*ny_global points should look like if visualized.
