\vspace{6pt}
The Adaptive Input/Output (I/O) system (ADIOS) is a joint product of the National 
Center of Computational Sciences (NCCS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) 
and the Center for Experimental Research in Computer Systems at the Georgia Institute 
of Technology. This work is being led by Scott Klasky (ORNL); Jay Lofstead (Georgia 
Tech, funded from Sandia Labs) is the main contributor. ADIOS has greatly benefited 
from the efforts of the following ORNL staff: Steve Hodson, who gave tremendous 
input and guidance; Chen Jin, who integrated ADIOS routines into multiple scientific 
applications; Norbert Podhorszki, who integrated ADIOS with the Kepler workflow 
system and worked with Qing Gary Liu on the read API. ADIOS also benefited from 
the efforts of the Georgia Tech team, including Prof. Karsten Schwan, Prof. Matt 
Wolf, Hassan Abbasi, and Fang Zheng. Wei Keng Liao, Northwestern University, and 
Wang Di, SUN, have also been invaluable in our coding efforts of ADIOS, writing 
several important code parts. Essentially, ADIOS is componentization of I/O transport 
methods. Among the suite of transport methods, Decoupled and Asynchronous 
Remote Transfers (DART) was developed by Prof. Manish Parashar and his student 
Ciprian Docan of Rutgers University.

\vspace{6pt}
Without a scientific application, ADIOS would not have come this far. Special thanks 
go to Stephane Ethier at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (GTS); Researcher 
Yong Xiao and Prof. Zhihong Lin from the University of California, Irvine (GTC); 
Julian Cummings at the California Institute of Technology; Seung-Hoe and Prof. 
C. S. Chang at New York University (XGC); Jackie Chen and Ray Grout at Sandia (S3D); 
and Luis Chacon at ORNL (Pixie3D).

Center (SDM) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the U.S. Department 
of Defense.
