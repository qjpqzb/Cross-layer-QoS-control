Flexpath Testing
================

Possible Test Setups
--------------------

1. Program which directly calls adios_flexpath functions and checks returns.
2. Program which forks readers and writers, which dump to file and checks file contents.

Existing Directories
--------------------

* global_range_select - runs tests using the global range selectors. Current tests are listed below:
	- 1 to 1 all to all

* scalar - read/write a scalar with (XML API)

* 1D_arr_global - read/write a 1D array of doubles (XML API)

* 1D_arr_global_noxml - read/write a 1D array of doubles but no XML API (analogous
  to 1D_arr_global)
  
* maya_noxml - inspired by maya; same variables written multiple times (doesn't work with Flexpath)

* maya_append - inspired by maya; testing the append mode (doesn't work with Flexpath)
  
How to build and clean the build 
--------------------------------
# build
$ make 
# clean
$ make clean

How to run regression tests (might be outdated 2013-09-04)
----------------------------
# be sure that appropriate paths for openmpi, mxml, and evpath are
# set appropriately
 
module list
Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) openmpi/1.6.3    2) mxml/2.7    3) evpath

There is a convenience bash script 

./run_tests.sh

Run it without options to see how to run all tests.

# to run test
# in one terminal run writers
./run_tests.sh -flx-w
# in the second terminal run readers
./run_tests.sh -flx-r

Notes
------
There are directories that are used to most of the tests (2013-09-04)

include
common

If you want to copy the individual regression test, then
copy the include and common directory and the test directory as well.
